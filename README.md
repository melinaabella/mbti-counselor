# mbti-counselor
a basic mbti-destressor generator

1. The program takes in user input based off the information given in the mbti_keys.py file.
2. The user's respective MBTI is assigned to the right information given in the table.py file.
3. Then in the user.py file, it has a function that will print results (de-stressing tips) that's assigned to the user's type.
4. mbti_counselor is the main program that combines everything together. 

This program covers all 16 types of personalities in the Myer's Brigg. I've done some heavy reading to make sure 
the right information is given. I will continue to research this field of Psychology in hopes to enhance this generator further.
